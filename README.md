# Store Sales Prediction Project 🛍️📈

Welcome to the **Store Sales Prediction Project**! This project aims to predict item sales using a variety of powerful tools and libraries. Below, you'll find an overview of the project, the dependencies used, and how to get it up and running in your local environment. Let's dive in! 🚀

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a robust machine learning model that can accurately predict store sales. By leveraging historical sales data, we aim to forecast future sales trends, helping businesses optimize inventory, plan marketing strategies, and improve overall decision-making.

---

## 🛠️ Dependencies

To ensure the project runs smoothly, we rely on the following libraries and frameworks:

- **Pandas** 🐼: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy** 🔢: For numerical computations.
- **Scikit-learn** 🤖: For machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
- **Seaborn** 🌊: For data visualization.
- **Matplotlib** 📊: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- **CatBoost** 🐱: For gradient boosting on decision trees.
- **XGBoost** ⚡: For optimized distributed gradient boosting.
- **Dill** 🥒: For serializing and deserializing Python objects.
- **Flask** 🌐: For creating a web application to serve the model.
